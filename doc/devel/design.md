# Django Testing Tutorial

## Summary
Implement a minimal Django project to demonstrate its development
steps, focusing on testing.

## Motivation
The classic methods of teaching usually involve presenting theoretic
knowledge to students with optional examples.

Students may have hard time to grasp how to connect the theory to
actually working on such a project, especially if they had no prior
practical experience.

To mitigate the gap, mentors need to invest time in helping individual
students to pick strategies and apply them in the field.

This tutorial project is aimed to help transfer the practical aspects
of working on a project.

### Goals
- Build a functional simple Django project with **tests**.
- Actively interact with students, requiring their participation.
- Cover topics that are required in an open-source environment:
  - Working with Git.
  - Working with GitHub Pull Requests (PR).
    - Reviewing PR/s: commenting, requesting changes and approving.
    - Posting PR/s: Fixing or suggesting enhancements.
    - Consuming a PR code base.
- Learn about tests in general and pytest in particular.
- Recognize the importance of CI.

### Non Goals
- Learn Python
- Learn Django
- Learn PyTest

## Design Details
The project is minimalistic to allow students to focus on development
strategies and less on the mechanics of the Django framework and the
pytest testing framework.
